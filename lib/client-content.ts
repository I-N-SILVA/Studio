    question: "Where should we start if we are new to AI?",

  {
    question: "How does pricing work?",

      "I quote a defined scope before work starts. After discovery, you receive a written proposal with the deliverables, timeline, and price. Larger implementations can be split into milestones, and any scope changes are agreed together.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will agents make decisions without our team?",
    answer:
      "We define what the system can do, what needs approval, and when it should stop and ask for help. The pilot includes examples from your workflow so we can examine its output and failure cases before deciding what to put into daily use.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing tools and data?",

      "I review your systems, access requirements, and data constraints before choosing an approach. Integrations, model providers, and any third-party costs are discussed as part of the scope. Sensitive data handling is a design decision we make explicitly.",

  {
    question: "Who owns the work, and what happens after launch?",

      "The project code and documentation are handed over to you, with deployment in your accounts. Third-party services keep their own licences and usage costs. We agree the handover period and support arrangements before launch, including who will monitor and maintain the system.",

    question: "Who will I work with?",
